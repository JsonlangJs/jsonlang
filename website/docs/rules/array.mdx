# Array

All Array/Collection operations


## All
  * Input[]: Array<any\> (Size: Unlimited).
  * Output: Array<any\> (Size: Unlimited).
  * Description: It takes an array of inputs and returns them again. It is used to run a list of `nested Rules`.
<JsonLangRunner example="18" height="20vh" key="example18"></JsonLangRunner>

## Filter
  * Input[]: Array<mixed\> (Size: 3) {elements: any[], iterator: string, rule: IJsonLangParams}.
  * Output: Any[].
  * Description: It accepts array of elements with any type to filter them using nested/inner rules, the filter rule will pass each elements as a Data with scope `Internal`, to access it by the inner rules, you will need to use [**Data**](./core#data) Rule with scope Internal and Iterator name.
<JsonLangRunner example="19" height="20vh" key="example19"></JsonLangRunner>

## Map
  * Input[]: Array<mixed\> (Size: 3) {elements: any[], iterator: string, rule: IJsonLangParams}.
  * Output: Any[].
  * Description: It accepts array of elements with any type to map them using nested/inner rules, the filter rule will pass each elements as a Data with scope `Internal`, to access it by the inner rules, you will need to use [**Data**](./core#data) Rule with scope Internal and Iterator name.
<JsonLangRunner example="20" height="20vh" key="example20"></JsonLangRunner>

## Foreach
  * Input[]: Array<mixed\> (Size: 3) {elements: any[], iterator: string, rule: IJsonLangParams}.
  * Output: true.
  * Description: It accepts array of elements with any type to iterate over them using nested/inner rules, the filter rule will pass each elements as a Data with scope `Internal`, to access it by the inner rules, you will need to use [**Data**](./core#data) Rule with scope Internal and Iterator name.
<JsonLangRunner example="21" height="20vh" key="example21"></JsonLangRunner>

## Flatten
  * Input[]: Array<mixed\> (Size: 2) {elements: any[], level?: number}.
  * Output: true.
  * Description: It accepts array of elements with any type to flatten this array with any level.
<JsonLangRunner example="22" height="20vh" key="example22"></JsonLangRunner>
