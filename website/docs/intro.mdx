# JsonLang

It is a Typescript package that provides a simple JSON Programming Language, allowing you to execute a safe logic in Frontend or Backend (NodeJS). Furthermore, it can be stored in the database and rendered to the Frontend-Side to execute/run some business logic.

JsonLang is designed to be extendable. You can define new rules with sync/async handlers.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install jsonlang-js
```


## Features

1. Typescript. It's a strongly typed npm package
1. the JsonLang structure is Simple and Optimized. Its [**structure**](#structure) and [**rules**](./rules/data.mdx) have a shortcut to make your JSON in a small size.
1. Its structure is always Consistent. i.e. `{"$R": "R1", "$I": ["value1", "value2", {"$R": "R2", "$I": [...] }, ...] }`.
1. Safe & Secure. Each Rule has a secure handler.
1. Extendable. Easy to add new rules.
1. Sync/Async. All rules in JsonLang are sync rules, but you can extend it and add async rules.
1. DRY. You can pass any rule result in a variable to be used in another rule which makes JsonLang JSON more optimized


## Structure

JsonLang have three main parameters:

  1. **$R**: (`String`) is the rule name itself. i.e. `and`, `or`, `==`, `>`.
  1. **$I**: (`any[]`) is an array of inputs which will be passed to the `Rule` handler/function, their type depends on the `Rule` handler, or it can be a nested rule
  1. **$O**?: (`Symbol [Optional]`), is an optional field, it accept a name of variable which used to save the Rule result in a [**variable**](./rules/data.mdx) and can be called in any other rule by `{ "$R": "Var": "$I": ["variableX"] }`. The output value should be unique. If you define the same value more than once, the last one will override the value of the previous one.


## Methods

### Execute

``` js
   execute = (jsonLang: IJsonLangParams, data?: {}): RuleResult
```
Execute is used to run the JsonLang and takes two parameters.

  1. **JsonLang**: check the [**Structure**](#structure)
  1. **Data**: schemaless data object to read/write to it. To get data use the Rule [**Data**](./rules/core#data)

Execute is the `Sync` version of JsonLang, use it to run all [**builtin rules**](./rules/data.mdx) and any [**extended**](./extend/customization.mdx) `Sync` Rules


``` js 
  executeAsync = async (jsonLang: IJsonLangParams, data?: {}): Promise<RuleResult>
```

Execute is the `Async` version of JsonLang, use it to run all [**builtin rules**](./rules/data.mdx) and any [**extended**](./extend/customization.mdx) `Sync` or `Async` Rules


### Extend

``` js 
registerOne = (ruleIdentifier: RuleIdentifier, ruleHandler: RuleHandler): void
```

Extend JsonLang by adding 2 params

1. **ruleIdentifier**: Object `{ name: string, shortcut?: string }`, `name`(required) is the `Rule` name, and `shortcut`(optional) is the shortcut. i.e `Sum` is the `name`, and `+` is the `shortcut`.
1. **ruleHandler**: Sync/Async Function `(...inputs: RuleInput[]) => RuleResult)`, `inputs`(required) is array of all inputs needs for the handler [**check Input in Structure**](#structure), and `data` is the schemaless data [**check Data in the Execute Section**](#execute)

``` js 
registerMany(rules: Rules): void
```
registerMany allows registering a `Map()` of rules. The `Map key` is `RuleIdentifier`, and the `Map value` is the `RuleHandler`



## **Try It**

### Example
<JsonLangRunner example="1" height="40vh" key="example1"></JsonLangRunner>

### Explain
1. Sum all 4 inputs
1. input 1: 1 + ( 2 * 3 )  + 5
1. input 2: 1 + ( 3 * 3 * 7 )  + 6 + 7, pass the value of ( 3 * 3 * 7 = 63 ) to a variable called `x`
1. input 3: get the value of `x` = 63
1. input 4: get the value of `user.age` = 100
